          despise riches, give alms to everyone that asks, stand up for the 
          stupid and crazy, devote your income and labor to others, 
          hate tyrants, argue not concerning God, have patience and 
          indulgence toward the people, take off your hat to nothing known 
          or unknown or to any man or number of men, go freely with 
          powerful uneducated persons and with the young and with the 
          mothers of families, read these leaves in the open air every 
          season of every year of your life, re-examine all you have been 
          told at school or church or in any book, dismiss whatever 
          insults your own soul, and your very flesh shall be a great poem 
          and have the richest fluency not only in its words but in the 
          silent lines of its lips and face and between the lashes of
